# Mandate Calculator
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kubikb/mandate_calculator.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kubikb/mandate_calculator)

This repository contains my Python implementation for the [mandate calculator](https://mandatumkalkulator.herokuapp.com/) model designed by Dániel Róna. For the detailed description of the model, please read the [methodology page](https://mandatumkalkulator.herokuapp.com/methodology).

## Prerequisites
1. Python 2.7 and Pip should be installed. On Windows, install Anaconda for Python 2.7 (https://www.continuum.io/downloads) and you'll be ready to roll.
2. Install the required Python libraries (don't do this if you use Anaconda): `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Running it

### Mandate calculation
The `MandateCalculator` class contains all the methods needed to do a calculation. Initialize a `MandateCalculator` object by giving it the following variables:

- `array_of_earlier_results` - This should be a numpy array of size 106*4 (since there are 106 SMDs and 4 political formations in the model). The ratios in this matrix represent the factual vote ratios from the latest election.
- `num_smd_votes` - Numpy matrix of number of votes from the last election for every SMD. Shape should be (106, 1)
- `factual_ratios` - A numpy array of shape (4,) that represents the national vote ratios obtained by each political formation
- `predicted_ratios` - User-predicted national vote ratios for each political formation. Also a numpy array of shape (4,)
- `votes_from_abroad` - Numpy array of votes coming from abroad for each political formation. Also a numpy array of shape (4,)
- `region_smd_array` - Numpy array of regional corrections for every SMD and political formation. Shape should be (106, 1)

An example on how to run it:
```
from mandate_calculator.model import MandateCalculator, MandateCalculatorException
import numpy as np

array_of_earlier_results = pd.read_csv("tests/files/results_2014.csv"),
                                       sep=";",
                                       encoding="UTF-8",
                                       index_col=0,
                                       decimal=",").as_matrix()
array_of_smd_vote_counts = pd.read_csv("tests/files/smd_counts_2014.csv"),
                                       sep=";",
                                       encoding="UTF-8",
                                       index_col=0,
                                       decimal=",").as_matrix().flatten()
array_of_regional_corrections = pd.read_csv("mandate_calculator/tests/files/smd_region.csv",
                                            sep=";",
                                            encoding="UTF-8",
                                            index_col=0,
                                            decimal=",").as_matrix()
                                            
factual_ratios = np.array([0.2669, 0.4355, 0.2029, 0.0547])
predicted_ratios = np.array([0.26, 0.34, 0.33, 0.05])
votes_from_abroad = np.array([1495, 122638, 2926, 574])

model = MandateCalculator(array_of_earlier_results=array_of_earlier_results,
                          num_smd_votes=array_of_smd_vote_counts,
                          factual_ratios=factual_ratios,
                          predicted_ratios=predicted_ratios,
                          votes_from_abroad=votes_from_abroad)
smd_mandates, list_mandates = model.calculate_all_mandates()
```

### Tests
Execute `nosetests` in the cloned directory. This will run all the unittests.
